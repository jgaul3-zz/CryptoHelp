# CryptoHelp
Tools created to help one break simple encryptions and world games

The original idea for this came following reading Simon Singh's The Code Book.
Granted, the techniques he desribes for solving cyphers still depend on the user to do much of the complex work, but I saw an opportunity to make that work easier.

The first folder contains a command-line tool for helping to solve monoalphabetic substitution cycphers, with the cyphertext either to be stored as a .txt file or directly copied into the code itself. Comments in the code (and prompts while using) should be sufficient to understand what to do to use the program.
